    <p>- The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around</p>
    <p> an element's content, inside of any defined borders;</p> <br>
    <p>- With CSS, you have full control over the padding;</p> <br>
    <p>- There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element</p>
    <p> (top, right, bottom, and left).</p>
